DSDA Data Extraction
====================

The Doom Speed Demo Archive hosts speed demos recorded for doom engine games,
including the original works by id, related projects such as heretic, and custom
content created by the community.
DSDA is currently hosted at doomedsda.us by Andy Olivera, who, along with
Opulent, has served the doom demo community for well over a decade.
The archive currently stores over 42k demos, with 3.5k hours of content.

The goal of this project is to create a new dsda, from scratch, implementing a
variety of features and improvements, such as support for additional categories,
heretic / hexen demos, zandronum demos, and extra stats / options.
This repository is for the parsing of the old archive and the extraction of new
data.
For the related work on the full stack of the site itself, see the work
`here <https://github.com/kraflab/dsda-r>`_.

The `DSDA client <https://github.com/oleksiykamenyev/DSDAClient>`_ has a variety
of existing scripts which will be used as a base for this repository.
