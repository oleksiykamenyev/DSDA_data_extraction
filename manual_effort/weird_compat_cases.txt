General:
Speedmap sessions commonly did not maintain a strict complevel requirement per player. In particular:
  - Abyssal sessions 1-15 had varying complevels per level
  - #doom sessions had varying complevels per level
  - DW speedmapping sessions had varying complevels per level
  - Same for SargeBaldy speedmapping sessions?


Specific wads/series
Armadosia 2005:
  - Mostly vanilla, but various maps are limit-removing and others are Boom-only
    - https://www.doomworld.com/vb/post/1347913

Arxangels:
  - Mostly limit-removing, some maps require either complevel -1 or *ZDoom

Chillax:
  - Compatibility is mostly irrelevant from the original design standpoint, made to play in MP on
  Zandronum. Fixes have been made to make maps possible in cl9.

Doomworld Mega Project series:
  - Various complevels with zero rules

Doom 64 EX:
  - Its own thing

Doom 64 TC:
  - Comes packaged with an old version of Doomsday

Eviltech:
  - Some maps need ZDoom, but mostly works in PrBoom+ complevel 2

Ludicrium:
  - Requires ZDoom, but maps seem to work in PrBoom+ except are semi-broken?

Quagmire (1994):
  - Broken on complevel 3 on the intended route, works in complevel 0 (Doom v1.2 compat), completable
  and maxable in both

Sunder:
  - One map breaks on cl9 due to Boomism, everything else works in cl2, no Boom features used
  explicitly
