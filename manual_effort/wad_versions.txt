Different versions, same wad filename. These will need to be investigated to see if internal versioning existed
in order to categorize them better. May want to investigate how significant the differences are too:
  1994tu: 2011-03, 2011-08, 2011-11
    - no internal version available
  afro: 1994-04-10 and 1994-04-18, the two wads appear to be virtually identical
    - no internal version available
  aliens: 1994 and 2000, 2000 version fixes critical bugs and updates for playability in modern source ports,
          otherwise no difference, fixes done by Quasar
  alt: 2012-05 and 2012-12
  andy: v1 and v2
  armadosia: 2005 and 2016, 2016 version has fixes for compatibility issues and such by Never_Again
  av: 1st release and 2nd release, 2nd release has a map replaced with a completely new map among other
      fixes
  btsx_e1: 2012, 2013, 2017
  chillax: 2011 and 2013
  d2twid: 2013-11 and 2013-12
  freedoom: 0.9, 0.10.1, 0.11
  f_ep2: 1st release and 2nd release
  gd: 2014-11, 2015-02, 2016-08

  ndcp2: 2009 and 2010
  nova: 2014 and 2015

Separate wads with same filename:
  2 (1994) and 2 (2013)
  666 (1994) and 666 (1998)
  anomaly (1997) and anomaly (2013)
  attack and attack (ML)
  best (1994) and best (2014)
  beyond (D1) and beyond (D2)
  bunker (1994), bunker (1995), bunker (1997)
  canyon and canyon (ML)
  carnage (1994) and carnage (1995)
  castle (D1) and castle (D2)
  cavern (1994) and cavern (1995)
  crypt (1994) and crypt (1995)
  depths (1) and depths (2)

  eden (D1) and eden (D2)
  escape2 (1994) and escape2 (1995)

    - Hellcore 2006 is version 2.0 of Hellcore 2004 with some major revamps and new maps, and with
    fewer maps, so they probably count as separate wads. Hellcore 1998 is entirely different.
  manor and manor (ML)
  mines 1995-07, mines 1995-12, mines 1996
  paradox (1996) and paradox (ML)

Different versions of the same wad:

    differences, though. thekeep2 also appears as WADPAK3 e3m2
